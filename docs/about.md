# About me

I graduated from MIT in June 2023 with a B.S in Computation and Cognition, an interdisciplinary degree which combines elements of Computer Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences. I have been coding in various languages since middle school, and I am especially passionate about using computer science to build and study intelligence. I am invested in finding ways to make sure algorithms and AI models are safe and reliable as they have an increasing impact on people's daily lives.

As a recent graduate, I am currently looking for jobs in Software Engineering/Development to build practical skills in working on complicated software projects deployed in the real world, with a long-term goal of working in more research-related roles in the future.

Note: I changed my first name late 2022 so some of my previous work is credited under a different name.
